### 42London - Libft
#### A recreation of a bunch of C standard library functions, and other utilities

This was the first project to be handed of the 42 Common Core. We create our first library, recreating many functions from the C standard library.`srcs/mandatory` and `srcs/bonus` comprise the functions required by the project itself. `srcs/extra` contains the following functions which I added myself since submission.
**MANDATORY** - The core functions.
**BONUS:** - These functions, along with the `t_list` type definition in `libft.h` comprise an implementation of a singly linked list:
**EXTRA:** - These are not a part of the original libft project:
- get_next_line
- ft_printf

`make` builds the static library `libft.a`
