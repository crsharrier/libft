### 42London - Libft
#### A recreation of a bunch of C standard library functions, and other utilities

This was the first project to be handed of the 42 Common Core. 

`srcs/mandatory` and `srcs/bonus` comprise the functions required by the project itself. `srcs/extra` contains functions I have added myself since submission, including some useful functions I made as part of other projects.

`make` builds the static library `libft.a`
